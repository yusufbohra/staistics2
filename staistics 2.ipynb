Let's look at each measure and provide an example to illustrate their usage:\\n\\n1. Range:\\n- Definition: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\\n- Use: The range gives an idea of how spread out the data is from the lowest value to the highest value. However, it only considers the extreme values and may be influenced by outliers.\\n- Example: Consider the following dataset of exam scores: [70, 75, 80, 85, 90]. The range is calculated as 90 (maximum) - 70 (minimum) = 20. This means the scores are spread out over a range of 20 points.\\n\\n2. Variance:\\n- Definition: Variance is the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean of the dataset.\\n- Use: Variance measures the average dispersion of data points from the mean. It considers all values in the dataset and is sensitive to outliers.\\n- Example: Suppose we have the following dataset of test scores: [80, 85, 88, 82, 90]. The mean is (80 + 85 + 88 + 82 + 90) / 5 = 85. The variance is calculated as ((80-85)^2 + (85-85)^2 + (88-85)^2 + (82-85)^2 + (90-85)^2) / 5 ≈ 10.8.\\n\\n3. Standard Deviation:\\n- Definition: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of dispersion in the original units of the data.\\n- Use: Standard deviation is widely used as it represents the average distance between each data point and the mean. It is easy to interpret and gives a sense of how the data points cluster around the mean.\\n- Example: Continuing with the previous example, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, so √(10.8) ≈ 3.29. This means that, on average, the test scores are about 3.29 points away from the mean score of 85.\\n\\nIn summary, measures of dispersion like range, variance, and standard deviation complement measures of central tendency in describing the characteristics of a dataset.

This means that there are more extreme values on the right side of the distribution, leading to a higher mean than the median. The mean is pulled in the direction of the long tail, and the median tends to be closer to the mode.\\n\\n2. Negative Skewness (Left Skewness):\\nIn a negatively skewed distribution, the tail on the left side of the distribution is longer or fatter than the right side. This means that there are more extreme values on the left side of the distribution, leading to a lower mean than the median. The mean is pulled in the direction of the long tail, and the median tends to be closer to the mode.\\n\\n3. Symmetrical Skewness (No Skewness):\\nIn a symmetrical distribution, the data is evenly distributed around the mean, and the tails on both sides of the distribution are approximately equal. In this case, the mean, median, and mode are approximately equal.\\n\\nSkewness is an essential concept in data analysis and interpretation. It helps researchers and analysts understand the distribution and the tendency of data to be concentrated towards one end or the other.
